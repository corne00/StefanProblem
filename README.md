# StefanProblem

This project was created two years ago as part of my bachelor project, in which I tried to find a second order accurate solution to the one-dimensional Stefan Problem. My programming experience was very little back then,
so please do not expect to much from this repository. If you want to take a look at the resulting bachelor thesis, it can be found here: https://www.google.com/search?q=c+verburg+tudelft+stefan+problem&ei=2XqAZOjsHeaN9u8PxvKEiAU&ved=0ahUKEwiovaSUl7H_AhXmhv0HHUY5AVEQ4dUDCA8&uact=5&oq=c+verburg+tudelft+stefan+problem&gs_lcp=Cgxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAQAzIHCCEQoAEQCjoICAAQogQQsAM6BQgAEKIESgQIQRgBUF1Y_Qxggw5oAXAAeAGAAbIBiAHXC5IBBDEwLjWYAQCgAQHAAQHIAQM&sclient=gws-wiz-serp
