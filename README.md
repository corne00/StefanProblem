# StefanProblem

This project was created in 2021 as part of my bachelor project, in which I tried to find a second order accurate solution to the one-dimensional Stefan Problem. My programming experience was very little back then,
so please do not expect to much from this repository. If you want to take a look at the resulting bachelor thesis, it can be found here: http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:cd5bff33-c5b1-442b-a93c-f8a4e65344bd
